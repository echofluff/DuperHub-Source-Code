# DuperHub Source Code (Discontinued Script)
DuperHub has recently been discontinued, so I'd like to make the whole project open sourced now, for anyone to edit.

# Information on the script.

This script was designed for the roblox game, limited time. The way the script works, is really fucking simple, it only uses a single remote event. That's it. There wasn't any massive coding in the main function of the script, of duplicating time, it was mostly just one remote function. Almost all of the give all 9Qn time scripts were built on loldontbedum/d'ad's original script, just remakes of it.

# Usage of script.

Since the script is now completely open source, and free for anyone to use, you are allowed to make your own GUIs, using parts of this script, or other scripts you made using this information.

# Final notes.

Yes, I reused the same variables like 20 times, the script is a mess, there's a lot that I could optimize in it, I know.
